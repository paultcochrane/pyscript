\section{Roadmap}

This is an annotated summary of the meeting that we had on the 18/02/2005 to
decide upon what needed to be done in PyScript and what a given release
number would define.

\subsection{Version 0.6}

Posters and talks should be finished.  What this means exactly is a good
question, however, the old presentation library \texttt{presentation.py} is
still usable.

\subsection{Version 0.6.1}

Add the quantum information library.

\subsection{Version 0.6.2}

Add debugging of PSObjs.  ???  Really?  That's not a feature though.  

\subsection{Version 0.7}

Plotting of data with matplotlib.  Could we do this internally?

\subsection{Version 0.7.5}

Caching?

\subsection{Version 0.8}

Clipping of objects and curves.  Definition of curves.  Filling of
objects/paths/curves.

\subsection{Sundry stuff to be done}

\begin{itemize}
\item Housekeeping and docs
\item Illustrative examples
\item Testing (unit testing and testing of ps output)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Way down the track}

Addition of SVG as well as or instead of postscript output?  Could we easily
add PDF output?  This would be cool to add PDF specials for talks so that
there would be transitions between slides.
