o Add the quantum information library.

o Add debugging of PSObjs.

o Plotting of data with matplotlib.  Could we do this internally?

o Caching?

o Clipping of objects and curves.  Definition of curves.  Filling of
  objects/paths/curves.

o Housekeeping and docs

o Illustrative examples

o Testing (unit testing and testing of ps output)

o Addition of SVG as well as or instead of postscript output?  Could we easily
  add PDF output?  This would be cool to add PDF specials for talks so that
  there would be transitions between slides.
