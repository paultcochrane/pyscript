~~~~~

- Added optical component eps library from Alexander Franzen
  (alexander.franzen@aei.mpg.de)

0.6.1
~~~~~

- Added documentation source files to distribution.

- Extended and rewrote sections of the Talk() class of the 'presentation'
  library (note that this is different to the 'present' library).  Also more
  completely documented the class in the user manual
- Implemented the use of user-defined styles for talks
- Complete rewrite of the Poster() class of the 'presentation' library; now
  has a more similar interface to that of the Talk() class of the same
  library.  Also documented the class in the user manual
- Implemented the use of user-defined styles for posters
- More completely implemented the 'electronics' object library; documented
  the objects in the user manual
- Extended the 'optics' object library and documented its usage in the
  manual
- Added some examples of usage of the 'optics' library
- Many changes in 'qi' (quantum information) library.  No longer causes
  error at installation :-)
- Added Arrow() convenince class ... a Path with a predefined arrowhead
- integrated Path and Arrowhead ... path now has a heads attribute which
  is a list of arrowheads to draw on path
- added a tangent() method to Path that returns a unit vector tangent to
  the path at a particular point
- code clean ups ... and documentation
- added an Arrowhead class
- added an iscale attribute to TeX to set initial scale (only time it's used)
  makes it easy to subclass at a given scale.
- Added HAlign and VAlign convenience functions
- Align is now a class that inherits from Group
  - no longer supports anchor attribute (not sure how useful this was esp as
    objects can now be appended) first alignable object added forms anchor.  
  - the change seems mostly transparent but may break some things
- Added a Dash() object to describe postscript dashes
- fixed up examples and added a few others
- Dot() now returns a bounding box
- objects that return null BBox()'s are ignored in Alignment operations
  This was chiefly to accomodate a Pause() object in talks
- Fixed bug with move and rotations commuting (thanks Adrian)
- curves can now be given just a direction at the end points (eg C(45,90)), 
  a "natural" curve will be chosen automatically. This is the first half 
  of the algorithm that Metapost uses which is really nice. 
  (next part is to choose curvature automatically in unspecified curves)
- last point of a closed path can be skipped (added automatically)
- P now has 'arg' attribute (in degrees), return angle of P relative to origin
- there is now a --version argument when running PyScript

- rewrote Path object: the internals have completely changed. 
  There have been some incompatible changes with previous versions
  but its now much closer to what I envisaged for the object
  Changes:
    - C() no longer takes numerical arguments
    - Path() no longer sublasses Area (this doesn't make sense really)
      so the points n,ne,e ... etc are not available for this object
      use either bbox() method or group and Area object with the path
  Additions:
    - Path takes 'relative' points R(), these are the same as P() but
      will be intepreted as relative to last point.
    - C() takes relative control points with R(). The first is relative
      the start the second to the end of the curve
    - path.length returns the length of the path (local co-ord system)
    - path.P(f) returns the point on the curve at fraction f of it's 
      length
- Finally added some docs for the Path object
- fixed bug with defaults for linewidth etc not being taken up
  (thanks Marcus)
- Color() can now take a Hex string, eg "#FF00FF", must start with a '#'
- object reference returned from group's append, insert and reverse
  This makes for convenient one liners
- Group() now has a reverse() function
- Pages now produces global BoundinBox and Orientation comments
- Fixed minor bug in Align, when passed single object

0.4
~~~

- Rectangle now can have rounded corners (r=...)
- Rectangle can have an Area or Bbox in its contruction
  to set size and position eg r=Rectangle(g.bbox())
- Added a reflect() method to AffineObj
- Added a shear() method tho AffineObj
- Added an Eps object ... produces a self-contained eps, and this
  object is used to generate the actual eps. You can also nest them
  if you wanted to.
- Eps output now conforms to DSC 3.0!
- rewrote render to use Eps.
- Added Page() and Pages() objects .. pyscript can now do multi-page
  postscript (or A0 posters etc), which also conforms to DSC 3.0.
- Fixed some bugs with Text() handling of fonts and attributes changes
- Dot can now take x,y argument instead of point
- scale() can take a single number for both axes

0.3
~~~

- Start of a Page() object for ps (as opposed to eps)
- Pyscript now redirects stderr to pyscript.log.  and gives info about
  what's going on etc etc, some basic command line switches for debugging
- Lots of changes to TeX's internals
- default units now cm
- group has insert function
- Paper now takes an orientation flag (portrait or landscape)
- showpage always written to EPS file ... should be able to send file straight
  to printer
- more of the docs written
- E() has been renamed U() (unit vector)
- Epsf() now complies with spec, takes an initial width/height
  argument for scaling
- added Align() and Distribute() functions
- added a presentation library for posters and talks
- munched some bugs
