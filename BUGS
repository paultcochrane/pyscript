- gv doesn't preview postscript files with nonstandard paper sizes properly.
  eg "screen" landscape will have the right part clipped.
  Workaround: use the -dFIXEDMEDIA switch in the gs options
  
- using LaTeX's color package will disable the color setting in
  TeX() as the latex color changes happen within the code that TeX()
  produces. 
  Workaround: if you need to use the color package you will have to 
  do all the color setting from within latex (for the TeX objects)
